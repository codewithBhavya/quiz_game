# Python Quiz Game

This is a simple Python quiz game where users can test their knowledge on various programming and computer-related topics. The game presents a set of random questions to the user, and they need to provide the correct answers within a specified time limit.

## Requirements

To run this game, you need to have the following packages installed:

- `pygame`: Used for playing sound effects.
- `inputimeout`: Used to set a time limit for user input.

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```
pip install pygame inputimeout
```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script using a Python interpreter.
2. The game will display a welcome message and start presenting random questions.
3. For each question, the user needs to provide an answer within the specified time limit.
4. If the user's answer is correct, a sound effect will play, and the score will increase.
5. If the user's answer is incorrect, a different sound effect will play, and they can choose to receive a hint.
6. After answering all the questions or when the time limit is reached, the game will display the final score and percentage.

## Quiz Questions

The game contains a set of predefined quiz questions stored in a dictionary. Each question is associated with its correct answer. If the user's answer matches the correct answer, their score increases.

## Hints

Some questions also have hints associated with them. If the user requests a hint, it will be displayed to assist them in answering the question.

Please note that the hints provided for each question are optional, and the user can choose to skip them.

## Timer

The game includes a timer feature that limits the time allowed for each question. Once the timer expires, the user's response is considered incorrect, and the game proceeds to the next question.

## Scores

After answering all the questions or when the time limit is reached, the game displays the user's final score and the percentage score achieved.

Please note that this game does not have a graphical user interface (GUI) and runs in the terminal/console.
